Improving the Dorm Experience was a project done for a design course at UC Berkeley. Our goal was to select a group of UC Berkeley students and improve an aspect of their life here on campus. We decided to focus on dorm residents as our target group because most UC Berkeley Students currently live in the dorms or have dormed previously.

<h3>The Problem:</h3>
Students face many restrictions as dorm residents, what is the biggest issue resulting from these restrictions and how can we improve it?
<h3>My Role:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Conduct Interviews and design survey.</li>
	<li>Generate possible solutions and assess their potential effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research Goals:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Determine which restrictions affect dorm residents the most.</li>
	<li>Assess how effective current solutions are to these problems.</li>
	<li>Generate low effort, high return solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Process:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Brainstorm and categorize prevalent problems that dorm residents face.</li>
	<li>Assess each category to determine which problems could actually be addressed.</li>
	<li>Conduct interviews to validate our list of problems, determine which problems were most prevalent, and see what existing solutions were being utilized.</li>
	<li>Create survey to gain quantitative data.</li>
	<li>Generate low effort, high impact solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Survey findings:</h4>
