Habit Hackers was a project Conducted for Information 214: Needs and Usability Assessment. We worked with a client, Tagalong, which was a mobile application that uses behavioral nudges to help form exercise habits and provide a platform to help people exercise together.

<h3>The Problem:</h3>
Despite having access to facilities, some other factors are keeping students from exercising regulary.
<h3>My Role:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Conduct Usability Tests with paper and low-fidelity prototypes.</li>
	<li>Create survey questions.</li>
	<li>Conduct contextual inquiry interviews.</li>
	<li>Provide feedback for client.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research Goals:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>What factors are preventing people from exercising regularly?</li>
	<li>How can we influence these factors?</li>
	<li>What motivates people to lead a tagalong?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Process:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Meet with client to learn client and app goals.</li>
	<li>Research and usability testing on existing exercise apps.</li>
	<li>Paper/lo-fi prototype Usability test and feedback.</li>
	<li>Additional research via survey on exercise and habit formation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Paper Prototype Usability Testing:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>People want immediate access to applications functionality: <b><em>consider removing setting preferences as the first step users do in the app.</em></b></li>
	<li>People were worried about spamming their friends with invites: <b><em>perhaps notifications via sms aren't the best method to notify a user's friends of tagalongs.</em></b></li>
	<li>People were wary about leaving post-activity feedback--they felt they were reviewing friends instead of the activity: <b><em>consider removing this feature of the app or be more specific on what the feedback is on.</em></b></li>
</ul>

</div>
<h4>Low Fidelity Usability Testing:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>There is a hierarchy that people think of when creating an activity: type, time/duration, and location: <b><em>utilize this thought process in the "Creating a Tagalong" screen to make this more intuitive for users.</em></b></li>
	<li>User prefer seeing other profile pictures instead of just activity icons--it makes them much more personal: <b><em>display profile pictures of the leader of a Tagalong instead of an icon.</em></b></li>
	<li>Other insights to investigate: do users have different perceptions of planning and commitment?</li>
</ul>
<h4>High Fidelity/App Usability Testing:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Not all features of the app were learnable. Users said words such as "dummy proof" that indicated some features needed to be much easier to learn and access.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h4>Survey Findings:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The big difference between exercisers and non-regular exercisers is exercisers were more willing to be spontaneous in creating exercise plans, but were also looking for commitment when establishing exercise partners.</li>
	<li>On the other hand, non-regular exercisers needed much more planning to set up exercise plans and believed companionship can help them form exercise habits.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Solution:</h3>
An app that allowed regular exercisers to create an Tagalong-an exercise event where other friends can join them while also allowing non-regular exercisers to browse different types of exercise events.
