Improving the Dorm Experience was a project done for a design course at UC Berkeley. Our goal was to select a group of UC Berkeley students and improve an aspect of their life here on campus.

<h3>The Problem:</h3>
Students face many restrictions as dorm residents, what is the biggest issue resulting from these restrictions and how can we improve it?
<h3>My Role:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Conduct Interviews and design survey.</li>
	<li>Generate possible solutions and assess their potential effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research Goals:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Determine which restrictions affect dorm residents the most.</li>
	<li>Assess how effective current solutions are to these problems.</li>
	<li>Generate low effort, high return solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Process:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Generated a list of problems that we thought were prevalent among dorm students and categorized them.</li>
	<li>We assessed each category to see which problems we could actually address and provide solutions for.</li>
	<li>We conducted interviews to assess and validate our list of problems and determine which were most prevalent.</li>
	<li>Create survey for more concrete data.</li>
	<li>Generate low effort, high return solutions.</li>
</ul>
