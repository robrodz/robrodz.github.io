Washer Talk was a prototype app made as a final project for the {design.} DeCal at UC Berkeley. This project was initially created as a solution to my own personal bug with laundry: care labels are difficult to understand and I never read them. But was shifted to cover other common problems that people experience when doing laundry.

	<h2>Research:</h2>
	</br>
	<h3>Survey</h3>
	A survey was created to was released to gather more Quantitative Data and more information from college students. Questions were asked regarding  laundry use, laundry process, and cuse are labels.

	Findings: There wasn’t a particular time that most people did laundry. There a wide range of times ranging from morning, noon, afternoon to night. There was also a nearly even split between those who did laundry on the weekend vs the weekday.Most people separated their loads by color or darks/lights but there was also a good amount of people who don’t separate their clothes at all.
	<br>
	<h3>Interviews</h3>
	Interviews were conducted to gather more in-depth and personal anecdotes about doing laundry. Interviews also revealed some new information that wasn't initially revealed in the survey.

	Key Findings: Though care labels can be a hassle for laundry do-ers, that didn’t seem to be the main problem. For the most part, people can wash their clothes with cold water on normal cycle without ruining most apparel. The biggest problem that was brought up in every interview was full washing machines/dryers, especially when the load is finished and the other person hasn’t taken their belongings out yet.

	<h2>Testing</h2>
	<h3>Card Sorting</h3>
	Using card sorting, we were able to see the “must-have” features as well as additional preferred features. Most testers placed a washer/dryer timer at the top of their priority list with the communication to other washer/dryer users shortly after. A care symbol reader was a feature that most users also wanted, but was not in the top of their priority list. Another user wanted a feature of the app that automatically removed the lint from the dryer. While this may not be entirely feasible, this did provide some inspiration for the type of reminders and notifications that could be included in the application.

	<h3>Paper Prototype Usability Testing</h3>

		<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/washertalk/paperprototypes.jpg" alt="" title="Paper Prototype"/>
	</div>
	Paper Prototypes were used to test the usability and function of the app and huge insights were revealed during the tests:
	<ul>“Notify” was a confusing label for the button used to communicate with others
		<li>The purpose of the app itself was misleading. Users thought the app did your laundry for you.</li>
		<li>The order of checking off things for the washer and dryer are not intuitive</li>
		<li>The scan feature was unclear</li>
		<li>Instead of calling it “scan,” call it your “basket.” As you add things to your laundry basket in real life, you can also add it in the app so you know which clothes you need to use special care for.</li>
		<li>Include your basket in the wash and dry load screens so you can select which clothes you’re washing and view the care labels for them.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>High-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
	Using the findings from Paper Prototype Testing, Hi-Fi Prototypes were created.

		<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/washertalk/HomeScreenonPhone.png" alt="" title="Home Screen Hi-Fi Prototype"/>
		<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/washertalk/Basketonphone.png" alt="" title="My Basket Screen Hi-Fi Prototype"/>
		<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/washertalk/ShirtonPhone.png" alt="" title="Shirt Screen Hi-Fi Prototype"/>
	</div>
	<h3>Next Steps for Further Testing</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Conduct further testing on Hi-Fi Prototypes</li>
		<li>In addition to Hi-Fi testing on the app, conduct testing with people using the app with their washer and dryer.</li>
		<li>Do market research of existing laundry apps and find how suitable this app is for the current market.</li>
		<li>What is the best way to send a notification to a person when someone reports that their laundry is done?</li>
		<li>What type of communication can be set up between the app and the appliances?</li>
	</ul>
