	Hi Fidelity Prototypes that we used to conduct usability tests.
</div>
Habit Hackers was a project Conducted for Information 214: Needs and Usability Assessment. We worked with a client, Tagalong, which was a mobile application that uses behavioral nudges to help form exercise habits and provide a platform to help people exercise together.

<h3>The Problem:</h3>
Despite having access to facilities, some other factors are keeping students from exercising regulary.
<h3>My Role:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Conduct Usability Tests with paper and low-fidelity prototypes.</li>
	<li>Create survey questions.</li>
	<li>Conduct contextual inquiry interviews.</li>
	<li>Provide feedback for client.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research Goals:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>What factors are preventing people from exercising regularly?</li>
	<li>How can we influence these factors?</li>
	<li>What motivates people to lead a tagalong?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Survey findings:</h4>
The big difference between exercisers and non-regular exercisers is exercisers were more willing to be spontaneous in creating exercise plans, but were looking for commitment in exercise partners. On the other hand, non-regular exercisers needed much more planning to set up exercise plans and believed companionship can help them form exercise habits.
<h4>Paper Prototype Usability Testing:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>People want immediate access to applications functionality.</li>
	<li>People were worried about spamming their friends with invites.</li>
	<li>People were wary about leaving post-activity feedback. They felt they were reviewing friends instead of the activity.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h4>Low Fidelity Usability Testing:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>There is a hierarchy that people think of when creating an activity: type, time/duration, and location.</li>
	<li>User prefer seeing other profile pictures instead of just activity icons--it makes them much more personal.</li>
	<li>Users had different perceptions of planning and commitment.</li>
</ul>
