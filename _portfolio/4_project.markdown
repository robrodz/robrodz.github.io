Design Challenge where teams were tasked with creating an app for coffee drinkers and presented low-fidelity prototypes.

</div>
Home Screen: We wanted the main action that a user would take from the home screen to be ordering a cup of coffee. So, we kept the types of actions very limited and made the button to begin a new coffee order very apparent.

New Order: Location
The first thing that needs to be done for a new order is to set the pick up location. This displays all the potential coffee shops in your nearby area.

New Order Screen: Pick Up Time
Users have the ability to set what time they wish to pick up their order. We considered displaying the time that the drink would be available, but ultimately decided that most coffee drinkers already have set times when they drink coffee and setting a pick up time would work best for this product.

New Order: Beverage
Once a location and pick up time is set, the types of beverages that are available at that location are displayed.
<div class="img_large">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/coffitivity/payment.png" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
Payment
Lastly, a payment method is selected: in-app via card or in-store.

<h3>Changes to Consider:</h3>
Consider the order of the tabs for new orders. We would conduct a few usability tests to determine whether which order of selecting a location, pick up time, and beverage is most intuitive.
