Design Challenge where teams were tasked with creating an app for coffee drinkers and presented low-fidelity prototypes.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/coffitivity/home.png" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/coffitivity/location.png" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/coffitivity/pickup.png" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/coffitivity/beverage.png" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>

<h3>Changes to Consider:</h3>
Consider the order of the tabs for new orders. We would conduct a few usability tests to determine whether which order of selecting a location, pick up time, and beverage is most intuitive.
